# Qadence2 IR
Qadence 2 IR is a Pasqal initiative, to define an intermediate representation structure for neutral atom devices. The structure captures the key elements of the platform while remaining agnostic regarding hardware specifications. The goal is to simplify instruction building of analog quantum algorithms, enabling optimized instructions and compilation processes of task-specific algorithms to different platforms. By using an agnostic instruction set, Qadence 2 IR allows digital and analog instructions to work together, extending its usability to the digital-analog paradigm. The IR uses static single-assignment to simplify differentiability when running simulations.
